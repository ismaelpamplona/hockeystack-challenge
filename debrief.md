# Debrief

## (1) Code Quality & Readability

- Inconsistent logging improved with contextual tags for traceability.
- Dense expressions (e.g., expiration date calc) could be split into named constants.
- Lacks input validation; defensive checks would prevent runtime errors.
- Some `.then()` usage could be replaced with `async/await` for clarity.
- Unused variables (e.g., `propertyPrefix`) and sparse comments reduce readability.
- Repetitive logic across entity functions (`contacts`, `companies`, `meetings`) could be abstracted.
- `fetchWithPagination()` was proposed to centralize pagination/retry logic.

## (2) Project Architecture

- All logic is packed into `worker.js`, making the project hard to scale or test.
- Proposed modular structure (`/entities`, `/shared`) would improve separation of concerns.
- Shared logic like account lookup and queue flushing should be extracted.
- Missing tooling like `.nvmrc` and Docker can cause environment mismatches.
- Node.js version is not pinned (`.nvmrc` or `engines`), which could cause version mismatches; I used Node.js 23.11.0 for this task.


## (3) Code Performance

- Original ETL run took 10+ minutes due to incorrect filter operators (`GTQ`, `LTQ`) â€” fixed by using `GTE`, `LTE`.
- Meeting ingestion implemented via legacy Engagements API using correct `offset` pagination and `type: MEETING` filtering.
- Retry logic uses exponential backoff but lacks concurrency, limiting throughput.
- No caching or request pipelining; batching is only based on size (2000+).
- Could improve with parallel entity fetches and enforcing 5s timeout per API call (as suggested in the README).
