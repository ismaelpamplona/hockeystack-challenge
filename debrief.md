## Debrief

### (1) Code Quality & Readability

- Logging was initially unstructured but was improved using consistent contextual tags.
- The code contains multiple repetitive `try/catch` blocks and duplicated logic in entity processors (`processContacts`, `processCompanies`, `processMeetings`), which could be abstracted into shared helpers to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
- The token refresh logic uses `.then()` chains inside `async` functions, which is inconsistent with modern `async/await` style and could be refactored for better clarity and error handling.
- Hardcoded property lists are used when fetching records from HubSpot, which makes updates tedious and error-prone. Extracting them into constants would improve flexibility and readability.
- There is no test suite or input validation. Even minimal test coverage or runtime schema validation (e.g., with `zod` or `joi`) would greatly improve confidence and reduce the risk of regressions.

### (2) Project Architecture

- The original codebase was monolithic, with all core logic bundled into a single `worker.js` file. This structure made the code hard to test, extend, or reason about.
- We refactored the project into a modular structure, separating logic by entity type and isolating shared concerns (e.g., access tokens, queueing). This improves separation of concerns and makes the system more scalable.
- Reusable logic like account lookups and pagination patterns should also be extracted to shared utilities to further improve consistency and maintainability.
- The project does not define a Node.js version using `.nvmrc` or `package.json > engines`, which could lead to environment mismatches. For this task, Node.js v23.11.0 was used and managed via `asdf` to ensure consistency across environments.

### (3) Code Performance

- The original ETL process took over 10 minutes due to a critical bug in the date filtering logic. It used invalid operators (`GTQ` and `LTQ`) instead of the correct `GTE` and `LTE`, causing repeated retries and delays. Fixing this dramatically improved sync performance.
- Meeting ingestion was implemented using the legacy Engagements API with proper pagination (`offset`) and filtering for `type: MEETING`.
- Retry logic follows exponential backoff but does not support concurrency, which limits throughput, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- There is no caching, pipelining, or concurrency at the request level. Batching is size-based only (e.g., 2000+), which works but leaves performance gains on the table.
- Enforcing per-request timeouts (as suggested in the README) and parallelizing independent entity fetches would significantly improve performance under load.
